# DSA 101 📚

Welcome to **DSA 101**, a repository where I document my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. This repository serves as a collection of problems, solutions, and notes as I explore fundamental concepts and practice coding challenges.  

---

## 📖 What You'll Find Here

- **Code Implementations**  
  - Various data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.).  
  - Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.).  

- **Problem-Solving**  
  - Solutions to popular DSA problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and **Codeforces**.  



---

## 🛠️ Languages Used

This repository includes implementations in multiple programming languages for better understanding:  
- **Python**    
*(More languages may be added as I progress.)*

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-101.git
   cd dsa-101
   ```

2. Study the solutions and try solving the problems yourself before referring to the code.
